  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Quick, easy and definitely delicious. Spicy sausage and creamy cavatelli is tossed with tangy broccoli rabe in a delicate chicken and wine sauce.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds ricotta cavatelli</li>
    <li>1 pound broccoli rabe, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound Italian sausage, removing from casings and cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>10 ounces roasted red peppers, cut into 1-inch strips</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons concentrated chicken stock (such as Knorr®)</li>
    <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatelli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Fill the same pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Add broccoli rabe; cook until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and onion; cook and stir until sausage is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in broccoli rabe, roasted red peppers, and garlic. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Dissolve chicken stock with white wine and water in a small bowl. Whisk in cornstarch. Pour chicken stock mixture into the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Bring sauce to a simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Pour sauce over cooked cavatelli and top with Parmesan cheese. Toss lightly and serve.</li>
  </ol>
